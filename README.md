# generator-wordpress-plugin

> The best way to setup your WordPress custom plugins.

## Installation

First of all, if you don't have it already installed on your system, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

Than install the **@wptools/generator-plugin** generator globally on your system.

```bash
npm install -g @wptools/generator-plugin
```

## Getting started

Now you have access to the generator through yeoman this mean you can generate new projects anywhere by typing:

```bash
yo @wptools/plugin
```

The generator will ask you some questions for setting the project configuration parameters and once is done the new project will be created.

#### Using subgenerators

Inside an existing project __generated with this generator__ you can also use many sub generators to go further in the project base prototyping, let see some examples:

```bash
yo @wptools/plugin:metabox MyMetabox
```

Create a new metabox called "MyMetabox", the subgenerator take one argument which, in this case, is the class name of the metabox. You can use any name you want but it will fored to be capitalized CamelCase suffixed by "Metabox" or more generic, the subgenerator name, for generated class names, in order to follow common coding standards.

You have also other subgenerators, once it starts it will ask you some questions, based on the subgenerator context in order to customize the class and element rendering.

```bash
yo @wptools/plugin:shortcode MyShortcode
yo @wptools/plugin:widget MyWidget
```

The generator will also take care to __update your plugin main class__ automatically to include the newly generated classes.

## Development

Until the module it's not yet available as a global npm module. A global module may be created and symlinked to a local one, using npm.

Move inside the project folder and type:

```bash
npm link
```

That will install your project dependencies and symlink a global module to your local file. After npm is done, you'll be able to call `yo @wptools/plugin`
