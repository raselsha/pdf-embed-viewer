# PDF Embed Viewer

> The "PDF Embed Viewer" plugin is a versatile tool designed to seamlessly integrate PDF files into websites, enriching user experience by allowing easy access to documents directly within web pages. With its user-friendly interface and customizable features, this plugin offers a hassle-free solution for displaying PDFs without requiring users to download them separately.

## Installation

First of all, if you don't have it already installed on your system, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

Than install the **@wptools/generator-plugin** generator globally on your system.

```bash
npm install -g @wptools/generator-plugin
```

## Getting started

Now you have access to the generator through yeoman this mean you can generate new projects anywhere by typing:

```bash
yo @wptools/plugin
```

The generator will ask you some questions for setting the project configuration parameters and once is done the new project will be created.
